# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Data-Analysis
• Predicting the presence of heart disease using python machine learning algorithms to diagnose the disease.<br>
• Using **supervised learning technique** the machine is trained to detect the presence of the disease<br>
• The Predictive model for heart disease detection to enhance their liability of heart disease diagnosis **using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) and another Neural Network methodology Random Forest** used to build mining models on a dataset. <br>
•  Since KNN had higher accuracy % than Random forest classification **KNN** is more preferred.<br>
• The ultimate goal is to combine the logistic regression model  based approach in the prediction of heart disease. The heart disease dataset has 303 observations of individuals out of which 297 observations are taken for consideration. <br>
• This system has predicted **87%** accurately more than the expert’s statistical analysis. <br>
• By this prediction of the disease the Doctor can suggest the preventive measures for the patients to reduce the probability of getting a cardiac ailment or reduce the further complication if the patient is already a cardiac victim. <br>

**1.DETECTION USING KNN**<br>
	• This classifier looks for the classes of K nearest neighbors of a given data point and based on the majority class, it assigns a class to this data point. However, the number of neighbors can be varied. <br>
  • It varied from 1 to 20 neighbors and calculated the test score in each case. <br>
  • This system has predicted 87% accuracy obtained when compared to random forest. <br>
<br>**OUTPUT:**<br>
**Obtained Correlation Matrix**<br>

**The Accuracy Obtained using KNN is 87% with 8 Neighbours.**<br>

**2.DETECTION USING RANDOM FOREST**<br> 
	• This technique is both a classification and regression oriented technique ,it is a mixture or set of multiple decision trees. <br>
	• The greater the number of trees in the random forest classifier, the greater the precision. <br>
	• It is used for the task of classification and regression, but can do well with the task of classification, and can solve missing values<br>

<br>**OUTPUT:**<br>
**Obtained Correlation Matrix**<br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86291751/122966256-bafb5f00-d3a6-11eb-82bf-30e89bbfbe2c.png)<br>
	• The accuracy we have obtained in **Random Forest Classifier** is about **82.41%**<br>
